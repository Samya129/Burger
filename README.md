# Burger [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

I created a burger devouring application with a homemade ORM. Together, it can log a user's request of their choice of deliciousness or maybe have another burger per their request. By following the MVC design pattern, I was able to query and route data in this application, AND used Handlebars to generate my html.

## User Story
```
As a user,
I want to be able to add the type of burger I want to order from the menu, devour it, order another burger per my request as many as I would like, and get rid of all the eaten evidence after I am done 
So that I can order, eat as much as I want, and go about my working day happily feed, full, and ready to tackle the rest of my day.
